                been found in part of Argentina. Maiztegui dedicated himself to the fight against this disease, carrying out health education campaigns for
                prophylaxis, researching the possible treatment, and collaborating with other scientific teams to unveil its etiology and develop a vaccine.

                the now successful prophylaxis and for the eventual treatment of the disease, that was once a serious health concern.</p>
